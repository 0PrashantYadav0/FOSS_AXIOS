# FOSS_Axios Assignment: Personal Portfolio Submission

Welcome to the **FOSS_Axios** assignment! In this project, you'll learn the fundamentals of Git, GitHub, and web development by creating a simple personal portfolio page. Follow the instructions below to complete the assignment.

## Instructions

### 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork the main repository to your GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button on the top-right corner of the repo.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the forked repository into your local system by using the following command:
```bash
git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
```
#### Note : Make sure to move inside the folder before next step
```bash
cd FOSS_AXIOS
```
### 3. Create a New Branch
Once cloned, navigate into the repository folder and create a new branch with your roll number as the branch name:

```bash
git branch <your-roll-number>
git checkout <your-roll-number>
```
OR you can do both with just one command
```bash
git checkout -b <your-roll-number>
```

### 4. Add Your Folder
In the project directory, create a new folder named with your roll number. This folder will contain your files: (You can create file using vscode as well)
```bash
mkdir <your-roll-number>
```

### 5. Create HTML and CSS Files
Inside the newly created folder, add an `index.html` and `style.css` file. These files will showcase your personal information. Feel free to add the following details:
- **Your name**
- **Roll number**
- **Photo**
- **Branch**
- **Skills**
- **Hobbies**
- **Any other information you want to share**

### 6. Add and Commit Your Changes
After adding your HTML and CSS files, use Git to stage and commit your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Added my portfolio files - <your-roll-number>"
```

### 7. Push Your Branch
Push the newly created branch to your forked repository:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <your_branch_name>
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request
Finally, head back to the original repository and create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository. Make sure to select your branch as the source and the main repository's `main` branch as the target.
